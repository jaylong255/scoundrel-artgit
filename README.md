# Scoundrel Artgit

It's like Git for art.

What if our art could be source-controlled? What if artists had an inter-dimensional portal gun and a time stone?

## Why is This Important?

## Tell Me a Story

I was thinking about the love/hate relationship between George Lucas and Fans of Star Wars. Particularly fans of the original trilogy (OT). It's intriguing the way Lucas believes that he has the right and the responsibility to update the films not just through re-mastering but contributing major edits using CG effects and even filming new scenes to add continuity with the greater mythology over time. Then the fans hate him for ruining films that were a major part of their lives. Most fans believe that the OT films should remain untouched forever. Then if you go all the way back to the original theatrical run of the first film, the versions that most of us consider to be purest version already underwent some amount of changes to prepare for the sequels. Then you could also say the big reveal in Empire was already an obvious retcon of the first film. My position is that NO ONE IS RIGHT! If I'm right, then how do we move forward? The answer is something like version control.
